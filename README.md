# 📊 Credit Default Predictor

An interactive machine learning dashboard to predict credit default risk using the UCI dataset. Built with Python, Streamlit, and scikit-learn, this project allows users to explore model performance, adjust classification thresholds, and export predictions easily.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Cleaned and engineered financial dataset (UCI credit default)
- Multiple ML models: 
  - Random Forest (original and balanced)
  - Logistic Regression
  - Voting Classifier
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Stacking Classifier (with SMOTE)
- Performance metrics: confusion matrix, classification report, ROC curves
- Export predictions with probabilities
- Interactive Streamlit dashboard

## 🧪 How to Use

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/haresh253/credit-default-predictor.git
cd credit-default-predictor
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` doesn't exist yet, install manually:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn imbalanced-learn streamlit joblib
```

### 3. Clean the Data (if needed)

```bash
python clean_data.py
```

This will generate `data/cleaned_data.csv`.

### 4. Train Models

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This will train models and save `models/stacking_classifier.joblib`.

### 5. Launch the Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

You can now view model performance, adjust thresholds, and export predictions.

## 📉 Dataset

**UCI Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset**

* 30,000 samples
* Features include demographic info, credit limit, payment behavior
* Binary target: Default payment next month

## 📈 Model Performance

The stacking classifier (LogReg + RF + SVC with GradientBoosting meta-model) was trained with SMOTE for class balance. Evaluation is done via:

* Confusion Matrix
* ROC AUC
* Threshold tuning

Sample AUC score: `> 0.75` (update based on your results)

---

## 🔮 Use Cases

This dashboard could be useful for:

* Financial risk assessment
* Exploring trade-offs in classification thresholds
* Feature impact analysis
* Benchmarking ML models in credit scoring

---

## 🛠️ Built With

* Python 3
* pandas, NumPy
* scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn
* matplotlib, seaborn
* Streamlit
* joblib
